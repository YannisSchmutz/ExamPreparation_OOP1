* The STATIC type of an object variable (reference) is declared type of the object variable.
    - The static type is known at compile-time by the compiler.
    - It is static, because it does cannot change.
    - E.g:
        BankAccount anAccount;

* The DYNAMIC type of an object variable is the type of the object it is currently pointing to.
    - The dynamic type is, in general, not known at compile-time.
    - It is dynamic, it can change at runtime.
    - E.g:
        anAccount = new SavingsAccount();  // Initialized as BankAccount before...

* Whether a method can be invoked is determined by the static type!
* But the dynamic type methods are called


* From a FINAL class can't be inherited.
    - Immutable ones should be final
* FINAL methods can't be overwritten
    - Methods which are called in the constructor should be final.
