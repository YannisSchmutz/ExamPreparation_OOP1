* Instance variables:
    - belong to concrete objects (instances)
    - Stay alive until no method uses the objects any longer, then the object gets collected
      by the garbage collector.

* Local variables:
    - belong to blocks (methods, loops, etc.)
    - Must be explicitly initialized
    - Stay alive as long as the block is executed

* Parameter variables:
    - belong to methods
    - Explicit parameters are initialized with the passed arguments
    - The implicit parameter this refers to the object on which the method is invoked â–¶ Stay alive as long as the method/constructor is executed

* Static (class) variables:
    - belong to classes
    - They should be declared private, except for static constants (final), which may be either private or public.
